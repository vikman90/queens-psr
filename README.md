[![CI](https://github.com/vikman90/queens-psr/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/vikman90/queens-psr/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a set of implementations of the famous N Queens Problem solver in
multiple programming languages. The N Queens Problem is a problem of placing N
queens on an NxN chessboard without any queen being able to attack the others.

## Features

- Efficient implementations.
- Utilize backtracking and constraint propagation to find a solution.
- Provides the ability to specify the number of queens (size of the board).
- Offers an alternative testing output of the found solutions.
